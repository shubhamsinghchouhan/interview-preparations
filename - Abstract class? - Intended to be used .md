Private, Public, and Protected
The key components of OOPs, encapsulation and data hiding, are largely achieved because of these access specifiers.

- Polymorphism? and types of Polymorphism? - Many forms. It is the property of some code to behave differently for different contexts.
    - Compile Time Polymorphism
    - Runtime Polymorphism
