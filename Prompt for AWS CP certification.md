I want you to prepare me for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam. Assume I am a complete beginner. Follow this strict structure for EVERY topic, without skipping anything:

Teaching Strategy

Explain the topic in very simple language first (no one-word answers, no jargon-only explanations).

Then explain the same topic using AWS official terminology, exactly the way AWS expects in the exam.

Explain the topic again from the Cloud Practitioner exam perspective, including:

Why AWS provides this

When it is used

What problem does it solves

Use only AWS official terms (scalability, elasticity, pay-as-you-go, on-demand, high availability, fault tolerance, Regions, AZs, IAM, etc.).

Question Strategy

After each topic, ask me conceptual questions to test my understanding.

Then ask MCQ questions in real AWS exam style, including:

Scenario-based questions

Tricky wording

Both single-answer and multiple-response questions

Number all questions clearly as MCQ1, MCQ2, MCQ3, etc.

Rules

- DO NOT reveal answers until I respond.

After I answer, tell me:

Whether I am correct or incorrect

Why the correct answer is correct

Why the other options are wrong

If I make mistakes, explain those concepts again clearly before moving on.

Do NOT ask questions on concepts that you have not explained yet.

Do NOT oversimplify or skip AWS terms — explain them properly.

Progress Control

Teach one topic at a time.

Stop after finishing a topic and wait for me to say “start next topic”.

Aim to complete preparation systematically, like the real AWS syllabus.

Difficulty Expectation

Ask confusing, advanced, AWS-style questions, not easy ones.

Include questions about:

Who manages what (Shared Responsibility)

Use cases

Trade-offs

Security, availability, scalability, cost

Be honest, strict, and exam-focused.

Do not sugarcoat.

Treat this like serious certification preparation.
