109. What are the key features of Python?
Answer:  Python is an
     interpreted language. That means that, unlike languages like C and
     its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run.
     Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.  Python is
     dynamically typed, this means that you don't need to state the
     types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You
     can do things like x=111 and then x=“I'm a string” without error 
     Python is well suited to object oriented programming in that it
     allows the definition of classes along with composition and
     inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++'s
     public, private).  In Python, functions are first-class objects.
     This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from
     other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first
     class objects  Writing Python code is quick but running it is
     often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately，Python allows
     the inclusion of C-based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized
     away and often are. The numpy package is a good example of this,
     it's really quite quick because a lot of the number- crunching it
     does isn't actually done by Python  Python finds use in many
     spheres – web applications, automation, scientific modeling, big
     data applications and many more. It's also often used as “glue”
     code to get other languages and components to play nice.

     accessed by any function in the program. Local Variables: Any
     variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable.
     This variable is present in the local space and not in the global
     space. Example: a=2 def add(): b=3 c=a+b print(c) add() Output: 5

     this are:

133. randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and define the range
     in-between [a, b).
      Answer: It returns the elements by selecting it
     randomly from the range that is specified. It doesn't build a range
     object.

134. uniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined
     in the range of
      Answer: [a,b).Iyt returns the floating point number

135. normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution
     where the mu
      Answer: is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is used
     for standard deviation.

136. The Random class that is used and instantiated creates independent
     multiple
      Answer: random number generators.

137. What is the difference between range & xrange?
Answer:
     functionality. They both provide a way to generate a list of
     integers for you to use, however you please. The only difference is
     that range returns a Python list object and x range returns an
     xrange object. This means that xrange doesn't actually generate a
     static list at run-time like range does. It creates the values as
     you need them with a special technique called yielding. This
     technique is used with a type of object known as generators. That
     means that if you have a really gigantic range you'd like to
     generate a list for, say one billion, xrange is the function to
     use. This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive
     system such as a cell phone that you are working with, as range
     will use as much memory as it can to create your array of integers,
     which can result in a Memory Error and crash your program. It's a
     memory hungry beast.

138. How do you write comments in python?
Answer: commenting is done
     using docstrings(strings enclosed within triple quotes). Example:
     #Comments in Python start like this print(“Comments in Python start
     with a #”) Output: Comments in Python start with a #

139. What is pickling and unpickling?
Answer: representation and dumps
     it into a file by using dump function, this process is called
     pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects
     from the stored string representation is called unpickling.

140. What are the generators in python?
Answer:

141. How will you convert a string to all lowercase?
Answer: Example:
     stg='ABCD' print(stg.lower()) Output: abcd

142. How to comment multiple lines in python?
Answer: commented are to
     be prefixed by a #. You can also a very good shortcut method to
     comment multiple lines. All you need to do is hold the ctrl key and
     left click in every place wherever you want to include a #
     character and type a # just once. This will comment all the lines
     where you introduced your cursor.

143. What are docstrings in Python?
Answer: These docstrings are within
     triple quotes. They are not assigned to any variable and therefore,
     at times, serve the purpose of comments as well. Example: ““” Using
     docstring as a comment. This code divides 2 numbers ““” x=8 y=4
     z=x/y print(z) Output: 2.0

144. What is the purpose of is, not and in operators?
Answer:
     corresponding result.    9
     is: returns true when 2 operands are true (Example: “a” is 'a')
     not: returns the inverse of the boolean value in: checks if some
     element is present in some sequence

145. What is the usage of help() and dir() function in Python?
Answer:
     used for viewing a consolidated dump of built-in functions.

146. Help() function: The help() function is used to display the
     documentation string
      Answer: and also facilitates you to see the
     help related to modules, keywords, attributes, etc.

147. Dir() function: The dir() function is used to display the defined
     symbols. Answer:

148. Whenever Python exits, why isn't all the memory de-allocated?
     Answer:

149. Whenever Python exits, especially those Python modules which are
     having
      Answer: circular references to other objects or the objects
     that are referenced from the global namespaces are not always
     de-allocated or freed.

150. It is impossible to de-allocate those portions of memory that are
     reserved by
      Answer: the C library.

151. On exit, because of having its own efficient clean up mechanism,
     Python
      Answer: would try to de-allocate/destroy every other object.

152. What is a dictionary in Python?
Answer: relationship between keys
     and values. Dictionaries contain pair of keys and their
     corresponding values. Dictionaries are indexed by keys. Let's take
     an example: The following example contains some keys. Country,
     Capital & PM. Their corresponding values are India, Delhi and Modi
     respectively.
     dict={'Country':'India','Capital':'Delhi','PM':'Modi'} print
     dict[Country] India print dict[Capital] Delhi print dict[PM] Modi

153. How can the ternary operators be used in python?
Answer:
        10 statements. This
     consists of the true or false values with a statement that has to
     be evaluated for it. Syntax: The Ternary operator will be given as:
     [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]x, y = 25, 50big = x if x
     < y else y Example: The expression gets evaluated like if x<y else
     y, in this case if x<y is true then the value is returned as big=x
     and if it is incorrect then big=y will be sent as a result.

154. What does this mean: args, kwargs? And why would we use
Answer: it?
     passed to a function, or if we want to pass a stored list or tuple
     of arguments to a function. kwargs is used when we don't know how
     many keyword arguments will be passed to a function, or it can be
     used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The
     identifiers args and kwargs are a convention, you could also use
     bob and **billy but that would not be wise.

155. Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python.
    
     Answer:  split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string
     into a list.  sub() – finds all substrings where the regex pattern
     matches and then replace them with a different string  subn() – it
     is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the
     no. of replacements.

156. What are negative indexes and why are they used?
Answer: negative
     numbers. The numbers that are positive uses '0' that is uses as
     first index and '1' as the second index and the process goes on
     like that.    11 The index
     for the negative number starts from '-1' that represents the last
     index in the sequence and '-2' as the penultimate index and the
     sequence carries forward like the positive number. The negative
     index is used to remove any new-line spaces from the string and
     allow the string to except the last character that is given as
     S[:-1]. The negative index is also used to show the index to
     represent the string in correct order.

157. What are Python packages?
Answer:

158. How can files be deleted in Python?
Answer: need to use the
     os.remove() function. Example: import os os.remove(“xyz.txt”)

159. What are the built-in types of python?
Answer:  Integers 
     Floating-point  Complex numbers  Strings  Boolean  Built-in
     functions

160. What advantages do NumPy arrays offer over (nested) Python Answer:
     lists?

161. Python's lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They
     support (fairly)
      Answer: efficient insertion, deletion, appending,
     and concatenation, and Python's list comprehensions make them easy
     to construct and manipulate.

162. They have certain limitations: they don't support “vectorized”
     operations like
      Answer: elementwise addition and multiplication,
     and the fact that they can contain objects of differing types mean
     that Python must store type information for every element, and must
     execute type dispatching code when operating on each element.

163. NumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You
     get a lot of
      Answer: vector and matrix operations for free, which
     sometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also
     efficiently implemented.

164. NumPy array is faster and You get a lot built in with NumPy, FFTs,
    
     Answer: convolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear
     algebra, histograms etc.    98869

165. How to add values to a python array?
Answer: the insert (i,x)
     functions. Example: a=arr.array('d', [1.1 , 2.1 ,3.1] )
     a.append(3.4) print(a) a.extend([4.5,6.3,6.8]) print(a)
     a.insert(2,3.8) print(a) Output: array('d', [1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.4])
     array('d', [1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.4, 4.5, 6.3, 6.8]) array('d', [1.1,
     2.1, 3.8, 3.1, 3.4, 4.5, 6.3, 6.8])

166. How to remove values to a python array?
Answer: difference between
     these two functions is that the former returns the deleted value
     whereas the latter does not. Example: a=arr.array('d', [1.1, 2.2,
     3.8, 3.1, 3.7, 1.2, 4.6]) print(a.pop()) print(a.pop(3))
     a.remove(1.1) print(a) Output:

167. 6 Answer:

168. 1
Answer: array('d', [2.2, 3.8, 3.7, 1.2])

169. Does Python have OOps concepts?
Answer: program can be solved in
     python by creating an object model. However, Python can be treated
     as procedural as well as structural language.

170. What is the difference between deep and shallow copy?
Answer:
        13 values that are
     copied in the new instance. Shallow copy is used to copy the
     reference pointers just like it copies the values. These references
     point to the original objects and the changes made in any member of
     the class will also affect the original copy of it. Shallow copy
     allows faster execution of the program and it depends on the size
     of the data that is used. Deep copy is used to store the values
     that are already copied. Deep copy doesn't copy the reference
     pointers to the objects. It makes the reference to an object and
     the new object that is pointed by some other object gets stored.
     The changes made in the original copy won't affect any other copy
     that uses the object. Deep copy makes execution of the program
     slower due to making certain copies for each object that is been
     called.

171. How is Multithreading achieved in Python?
Answer:

172. Python has a multi-threading package but if you want to
     multi-thread to speed
      Answer: your code up, then it's usually not a
     good idea to use it.

173. Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
     The GIL
      Answer: makes sure that only one of your 'threads' can
     execute at any one time. A thread acquires the GIL, does a little
     work, then passes the GIL onto the next thread.

174. This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your
     threads
      Answer: are executing in parallel, but they are really just
     taking turns using the same CPU core.

175. All this GIL passing adds overhead to execution. This means that if
     you want
      Answer: to make your code run faster then using the
     threading package often isn't a good idea.

176. What is the process of compilation and linking in python?
Answer:
     without any error and the linking can be done only when it passes
     the compiled procedure. If the dynamic loading is used then it
     depends on the style that is being provided with the system. The
     python interpreter can be used to provide the dynamic loading of
     the configuration setup files and will rebuild the interpreter. The
     steps that are required in this as:

177. Create a file with any name and in any language that is supported
     by the
      Answer: compiler of your system. For example file.c or
     file.cpp

178. Place this file in the Modules/ directory of the distribution which
     is getting
      Answer: used.

179. Add a line in the file Setup.local that is present in the Modules/
     directory. Answer:

180. Run the file using spam file.o Answer:

181. After a successful run of this rebuild the interpreter by using the
     make
      Answer: command on the top-level directory. 
       14

182. If the file is changed then run rebuildMakefile by using the
     command as 'make
      Answer: Makefile'.

183. What are Python libraries? Name a few of them.
Answer: Python
     libraries are a collection of Python packages. Some of the majorly
     used python libraries are – Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and
     many more.

184. What is split used for?
Answer: The split() method is used to
     separate a given string in Python. Example: a=“IIES python”
     print(a.split()) Output: ['IIES', 'python']

185. How to import modules in python?
Answer: Modules can be imported
     using the import keyword. You can import modules in three ways-
     Example: import array #importing using the original module name
     import array as arr # importing using an alias name from array
     import * #imports everything present in the array module OOPS

186. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example.
Answer: methods) of
     another class. Inheritance provides code reusability, makes it
     easier to create and maintain an application. The class from which
     we are inheriting is called super-class and the class that is
     inherited is called a derived / child class. They are different
     types of inheritance supported by Python:

187. Single Inheritance – where a derived class acquires the members of
     a single
      Answer: super class.

188. Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 in inherited from base
     class base1,
      Answer: and d2 are inherited from base2.

189. Hierarchical inheritance – from one base class you can inherit any
     number of
      Answer: child classes   
      15

190. Multiple inheritance – a derived class is inherited from more than
     one base
      Answer: class.

191. How are classes created in Python?
Answer: Example: class Employee:
     def init(self, name): self.name = name E1=Employee(“abc”)
     print(E1.name) Output: abc

192. What is monkey patching in Python?
Answer: class or module at
     run-time. Consider the below example: # m.py class MyClass: def
     f(self): print “f()” We can then run the monkey-patch testing like
     this: import m def monkey_f(self): print “monkey_f()” m.MyClass.f =
     monkey_f obj = m.MyClass() obj.f() The output will be as below:
     monkey_f() As we can see, we did make some changes in the behavior
     of f() in MyClass using the function we defined, monkey_f(),
     outside of the module m.

193. Does python support multiple inheritance?
Answer: parent classes.
     Python does support multiple inheritance, unlike Java.

194. Define encapsulation in Python?
Answer: in an example of
     encapsulation.

195. How do you do data abstraction in Python?
Answer: implementation
     from the world. It can be achieved in Python by using interfaces
     and abstract classes.

196. Does python make use of access specifiers?
Answer: lays down the
     concept of prefixing the name of the variable, function or method
     with a single or double underscore to imitate the behavior of
     protected and private access specifiers.

197. How to create an empty class in Python?
Answer: It can be created
     using the pass keyword. However, you can create objects of this
     class outside the class itself. IN PYTHON THE PASS command does
     nothing when its executed. it's a null statement. For example-
     class a: &amp;amp;nbsp; pass obj=a() obj.name=“xyz” print(“Name
     =”,obj.name) Output: Name = xyz

198. What does an object() do?
Answer: take any parameters. Python

204. Explain what Flask is and its benefits?
Answer: good intentions”
     BSD license. Werkzeug and Jinja2 are two of its dependencies. This
     means it will have little to no dependencies on external libraries.
     It makes the framework light while there is a little dependency to
     update and fewer security bugs. A session basically allows you to
     remember information from one request to another. In a flask, a
     session uses a signed cookie so the user can look at the session
     contents and modify. The user can modify the session if only it has
     the secret key Flask.secret_key.

205. Is Django better than Flask?
Answer: functions in Python. Flask is
     much simpler compared to Django but, Flask does not do a lot for
     you meaning you will need to specify the details, whereas Django
     does a lot for you wherein you would not need to do much work.
     Django consists of prewritten code, which the user will need to
     analyze whereas Flask gives the users to create their own code,
     therefore, making it simpler to understand the code. Technically
     both are equally good and both contain their own pros and cons.

206. Mention the differences between Django, Pyramid and Flask. Answer:
        19  Flask is a
     “microframework” primarily build for a small application with
     simpler requirements. In flask, you have to use external libraries.
     Flask is ready to use.  Pyramid is built for larger applications.
     It provides flexibility and lets the developer use the right tools
     for their project. The developer can choose the database, URL
     structure, templating style and more. Pyramid is heavy
     configurable.  Django can also be used for larger applications
     just like Pyramid. It includes an ORM.

207. Discuss Django architecture.
Answer: Figure: Python Interview
     Questions – Django Architecture The developer provides the Model,
     the view and the template then just maps it to a URL and Django
     does the magic to serve it to the user.

208. Explain how you can set up the Database in Django.
Answer: with
     module level representing Django settings. Django uses SQLite by
     default; it is easy for Django users as such it won't require any
     other type of installation. In the case your database choice is
     different that you have to the following keys in the DATABASE
     'default' item to match your database connection settings. 
     Engines: you can change the database by using
     'django.db.backends.sqlite3' , 'django.db.backeneds.mysql',
     'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
     'django.db.backends.oracle' and so on  Name: The name of your
     database. In the case if you are using SQLite as your database, in
     that case, database will be a file on your computer, Name should be
     a full absolute path, including the file name of that file.  If
     you are not choosing SQLite as your database then settings like
     Password, Host, User, etc. must be added. Django uses SQLite as a
     default database, it stores data as a single file in the
     filesystem. If you do have a database server—PostgreSQL, MySQL,
     Oracle, MSSQL—and want to use it rather than SQLite, then use your
     database's administration tools to create a new database for your
     Django project. Either way,    98869
     20008 20 with your (empty) database in place, all that remains is
     to tell Django how to use it. This is where your project's
     settings.py file comes in. We will add the following lines of code
     to the setting.py file: DATABASES = { 'default': { 'ENGINE' :
     'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME' : os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
     'db.sqlite3'), } }

209. Mention what the Django templates consist of.
Answer: CSV, HTML,
     etc. A template contains variables that get replaced with values
     when the template is evaluated and tags (% tag %) that control the
     logic of the template. Figure: Python Interview Questions – Django
     Template

210. Explain the use of session in Django framework?
Answer: visitor
     basis. Django abstracts the process of sending and receiving
     cookies, by placing a session ID cookie on the client side, and
     storing all the related data on the server side. Figure: Python
     Interview Questions – Django Framework So the data itself is not
     stored client side. This is nice from a security perspective.

211. List out the inheritance styles in Django.
Answer: 
       21

212. Abstract Base Classes: This style is used when you only want
     parent's class
      Answer: to hold information that you don't want to
     type out for each child model.

213. Multi-table Inheritance: This style is used If you are sub-classing
     an existing
      Answer: model and need each model to have its own
     database table.

214. Proxy models: You can use this model, If you only want to modify
     the Python
      Answer: level behavior of the model, without changing
     the model's fields. Web Scraping – Python Interview Questions

     #Returns 50th percentile, e.g. median print(p) Output 3

224. What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy?
Answer:

225. In an ideal world, NumPy would contain nothing but the array data
     type and
      Answer: the most basic operations: indexing, sorting,
     reshaping, basic elementwise functions, et cetera.

226. All numerical code would reside in SciPy. However, one of NumPy's
     important
      Answer: goals is compatibility, so NumPy tries to retain
     all features supported by either of its predecessors.

227. Thus NumPy contains some linear algebra functions, even though
     these more
      Answer: properly belong in SciPy. In any case, SciPy
     contains more fully-featured versions of the linear algebra
     modules, as well as many other numerical algorithms.

228. If you are doing scientific computing with python, you should
     probably install
      Answer: both NumPy and SciPy. Most new features
     belong in SciPy rather than NumPy.

229. How do you make 3D plots/visualizations using NumPy/SciPy?
Answer:
     just as in the 2D case, packages exist that integrate with NumPy.
     Matplotlib provides basic 3D plotting in the mplot3d subpackage,
     whereas Mayavi provides a wide range of high-quality 3D
     visualization features, utilizing the powerful VTK engine.

230. Which of the following statements create a dictionary? (Multiple
    
     Answer: Correct Answers Possible) a) d = {} b) d = {“john”:40,
     “peter”:45} c) d = {40:”john”, 45:”peter”} d) d = (40:”john”,
     45:”50”) Dictionaries are created by specifying keys and values.

231. Which one of these is floor division?
Answer: a) / b) // c) % d)
     None of the mentioned When both of the operands are integer then
     python chops out the fraction part and gives you the round off
     value, to get the accurate answer use floor division. For ex, 5/2 =
     2.5 but both of the operands are integer so answer of this
     expression in python is 2. To get the 2.5 as the answer, use floor
     division using //. So, 5//2 = 2.5

232. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?
Answer: a) 31
     characters b) 63 characters    98869
     20008 24 c) 79 characters d) None of the above Identifiers can be
     of any length.

233. Why are local variable names beginning with an underscore Answer:
     discouraged? a) they are used to indicate a private variables of a
     class b) they confuse the interpreter c) they are used to indicate
     global variables d) they slow down execution As Python has no
     concept of private variables, leading underscores are used to
     indicate variables that must not be accessed from outside the
     class.

234. Which of the following is an invalid statement?
Answer: a) abc =
     1,000,000 b) a b c = 1000 2000 3000 c) a,b,c = 1000, 2000, 3000 d)
     a_b_c = 1,000,000 Spaces are not allowed in variable names.

235. What is the output of the following?
Answer: try: if '1' != 1:
     raise “someError” else: print(“someError has not occured”) except
     “someError”: print (“someError has occured”) a) someError has
     occured b) someError has not occured c) invalid code d) none of the
     above    25 A new
     exception class must inherit from a BaseException. There is no such
     inheritance here. / f = None for i in range (5): with
     open(“data.txt”, “w”) as f: if i &amp;gt; 2: break print
     f.closed a) True b) False c) None d) Error The WITH statement when
     used with open file guarantees that the file object is closed when
     the with block exits.

236. Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, 25], What is list1[-1] ?
    
     Answer: a) Error b) None c) 25 d) 2 The index -1 corresponds to the
     last index in the list.

237. To open a file c:scores.txt for writing, we use
Answer: a) outfile
     = open(“c:scores.txt”, “r”) b) outfile = open(“c:scores.txt”,
     “w”) c) outfile = open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “r”) d) outfile =
     open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “o”) file is being written to.

238. When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?
Answer: a)
     always b) when an exception occurs c) when no exception occurs d)
     when an exception occurs into except block
